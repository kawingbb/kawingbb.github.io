**Project description:** 

Every time someone makes a choice, parallel worlds branch off to play out differently based on what one did.

But what if, both of the outcomes play out simultaneously, where both the base and branches of roots can be observed in the same world?

Enter Thought Experiment, where all choices you make impact the world at the same time. You will see other "you" acts upon the world. In this world, choices will have dire consequences. Uncover what is possible and the truth behind the roots of parallel worlds.

**Tools:** Unity
