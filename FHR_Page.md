**Project description:** Urbanisation is a huge challenge for wild animals. As human keep developing and occupying most of the resources, it breaks the urban-rural balance and make wild animals become more difficult to survive. Wild animals have to fight for limited resources under the domination of human. In the game, players will act as one kind of wild animal and compete with other teams. They have to make use of their advantages to win the resource battle, and build their own house as fast as they can to protect their team members.

**Tools:** Unity, Maya
